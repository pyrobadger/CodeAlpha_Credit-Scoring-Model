# CodeAlpha_Credit-Scoring-Model

This Credit Scoring Model is a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether someone has good or bad credit based on synthetic financial and personal data. It generates fake but realistic data (like income, age, credit history, etc.), engineers new features to make the data more informative, and then trains several models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. It also compares their performance using accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and visualizations like ROC curves and feature importance. Itâ€™s a great all-in-one setup to understand how credit scoring systems work in practice.
